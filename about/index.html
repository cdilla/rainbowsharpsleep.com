From the brightest neon lit street to the dimmest alleyway corner, and the tallest skyscraper to smallest cabin, from the largest work of public art to the design on a manhole cover, and the newest shiniest gadget to the rustiest abandoned bike, Tokyo has an endless fascination for me.</p>
<p>RainbowSharpSleep is a means for me to record and share a small portion of what I see and photograph during my all too brief stays in wonderful Tokyo.</p>
<p>Why Rainbow Sharp Sleep? It is a <a href="https://what3words.com/rainbow.sharp.sleep"target="_blank">What 3 Words location</a> close to the Hachiko Memorial Statue. One of my favourite locations in Tokyo.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-categories">A note on Categories</h2>
<p>A note on the categories you will see each post attributed to. These are derived from the 1960 book, &ldquo;The Image of the City&rdquo;, by urban theorist Kevin Lynch.</p>
<h3 id="path">path:</h3>
<p>Channels along which the observer often, occasionally or potentially moves. They may be streets, walkways, transit lines, canals, railroads. For many people, these are the predominant elements in their perception of a city. For example, Takeshita Dori or the Sumida river.</p>
<h3 id="edge">edge:</h3>
<p>The linear elements not used or considered as paths by the observer. They are the boundaries between two phases, linear breaks in continuity, lines along which two regions are related and joined together. For example the borders of Yoyogi Park.</p>
<h3 id="district">district:</h3>
<p>The medium-to-large sections of the city, conceived of as having a two-dimensional extent, which the observer mentally enters, and which are recognizable as having some common, identifying character. For example the Wards and Special Wards of Tokyo.</p>
<h3 id="node">node:</h3>
<p>The strategic spots in a city into which an observer can enter, and which are the intensive foci to and from which they are traveling. Places of a break in transportation, a crossing or convergence, moments of shift. For example Marunouch Plaza or the Shinjuku Station complex.</p>
<h3 id="landmark">landmark:</h3>
<p>Landmarks are another type of point-reference, but in this case the observer does not enter within them, they are external. They are usually a simply defined physical object, building, sign, store, or geographic element. For example Tokyo Tower, the Hachiko statue or Ginza Wako.</p>
